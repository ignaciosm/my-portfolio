Cool things I added:
-Hamburger menu without using bootstrap
-Add some JS into the navbar so when you scroll down it changes the background to white
-Hero image gradient (lighter in the middle) so the text on top is more readable
-About page teammates change style when you hover over them
-Used vw for the font size in the button 'how it works'
-Used parametric mixins
-Use text slider against hero image# my-portfolio
